# Resume Builder

This is my updated resume built using React! I like to revisit this often and make small tweaks and adjustments to keep everything up to date and looking the best that it can. This was one of the first projecs that I worked on when learning react and I learned a lot from how it was buit and how to subtract and add diffrent elements. This resume was originaly built as a template by <a href="https://github.com/sitek94">Maciek Sitkowski</a>.
