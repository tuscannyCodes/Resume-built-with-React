# Resume Builder

This is my updated resume built using React! I like to revisit this often and make small tweaks and adjustments to keep everything up to date and looking the best it can. This was one of my first projecs I worked on when learning react and I learned alot from how it was buit and how to subtract and add diffrent elements. This resume was originaly built as a template by <a href="https://github.com/sitek94">Maciek Sitkowski</a>! Ive learned so much from him, and want to thank him so much for helping me learn how to code in React through this project, his youtube videos, and his numorous contributions on FreeCodeCamp.com.
